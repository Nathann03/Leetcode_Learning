## Thoughts and Things to Remember for strings and arrays

The main idea for most strings and arrays is to use a hash to make it O(N), usually sorting is never the correct solution, but may be a part of it if it is long.

# Techniques to remember

1. Using the power of dictionaries (hashmap) since it has O(n) creating and O(1) accessing
2. Breaking apart a problem, so if there are clear subproblems in a question break it apart (ex. check out M238, postfix prefix sub prob)
3. Using multiple dictionaries and lists since it is all O(n) in the end!
