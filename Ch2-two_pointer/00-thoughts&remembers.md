## Thoughts and Things to Remember for two pointer

The main idea of two-pointer problems in the context of LeetCode refers to a common approach for solving certain types of problems. This approach involves using two pointers (indices) that traverse an array or a linked list in a specific manner to solve the problem efficiently.

There are generally two types of two-pointer techniques:

1. Two Pointers Moving Towards Each Other:
In this technique, two pointers start from different ends of the array or list and move towards each other until they meet or cross paths. This approach is often used when the array or list is sorted or has some specific order. The pointers can be initialized at the start and end of the array or list, and they are updated based on certain conditions or comparisons.

# Example problems that can be solved using this technique include:

Two Sum II - Input array is sorted
Reverse String
Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array


2. Two Pointers Moving Together:
In this technique, two pointers start at the same position and move through the array or list together, usually with a fixed distance or a specific pattern. This approach is often used to solve problems related to finding subarrays or sublists with specific properties or satisfying certain conditions.

# Example problems that can be solved using this technique include:

Container With Most Water
Trapping Rain Water
Linked List Cycle Detection

The main idea behind both techniques is to efficiently traverse the array or list using two pointers to solve the problem in a more optimized way compared to brute force or other approaches. By leveraging the specific properties of the problem and the ordering or structure of the data, the two-pointer approach can often provide a faster and more elegant solution.
