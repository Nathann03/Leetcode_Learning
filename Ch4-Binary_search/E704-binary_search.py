"""
Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
"""

"""
Thought Process:

Naive:
O(n) linear search through entire list until you find it

Magic:
Using Binary Search, where we keep "splitting" the list in half
and checking the middle number to see if it is target, we can get O(log n)
runtime!

class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2

            if nums[mid] == target:
                return mid
            elif nums[mid] < target:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        
        return -1
