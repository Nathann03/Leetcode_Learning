"""
Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated 
between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]
might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 
1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, 
return the minimum element of this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] 
and it was rotated 4 times.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was 
rotated 4 times.

Thought Process:

Naive:

The O(n) linear search solution to this would be since we know
that all the values will always be ascending since it is rotated
to the "right" the values will always been ascending and the
first less than number will be our minimum.


Magic:

Since the problem gives us a massive hint towards the solution in its
requirements lets use it. The obvious solution for an O(log n) req
problem is binary search, so the question is how do we use it?

So to find the minimum, since we know that the left most point
of the array will always be higher than the right most point 
of the array due to how it is rotated, we can use that advantage
as when we check the middle point, we want to see if the middle
has gone past the dip due to the rotation. If it has, them we can set
that point - 1 as our end since we always want the right most point
to be less than our left value. Eventually we will converge to 
left being the original max and right most point of our non-rotated
array and our right ptr will be the min of the non rotated array.

Crux of this problem: Pivots, so the main idea of solving this is
understanding that there is a pivot point that need middle needs
to be and use it as a comparison to find out/guess where the true
pivot (amt of rotations/ min amt is pivot) might be.
