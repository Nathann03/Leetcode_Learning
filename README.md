# Leetcode
This repository is the collection of all the leetcode that I have done so far and my thought process as I was working on them.
If this helps you during your journey, give me a star!

# Things to note
This is constantly being updated and I will try me best to give both the Naive/Brute-Force method and the *Magic* solution that is optimal.
I also have a lot of good documents that I refer to in this repo, so hoepfully these help you!

The main guide I am following is Neetcode's pathway as it is very helpful in developing your skills and giving video solutions. All of these solutions of mine are in Python since that is the optimal language to complete leetcode questions IMO.
